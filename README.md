inpired by this project, that's really a great job.

## changes

Yet I wanted sth more, so I spent a few days refactoring that project, mainly including:

1. Serializing all steps with a pipeline object, you can find it in pipeline/pipeline.py.
2. Added proxy server related settings, which are obviously valuable for some regions...may be the most import improvement I'v done here, haha...
3. Refactored the crawler part to make it easier for people with programming basics to add more specific website dedicated crawlers. You can even develop a "crawler" that reads local files, providing pre-prepared materials for subsequent steps, instead of using less controllable network data.
4. Before starting the retrieval and crawler steps, the report outline was first generated using LLM, and the subsequent retrieval and crawling were all around this outline, significantly improved the relevance of the retrieved content and the final report.
5. Added introspection mechanism, the content of the crawled page will first use LLM to judge the relevance to the final report, and irrelevant documents will be discarded. This feature improves the relevance between the input materials and the final report. Specifically, I also found the timeliness issue of search results, so I require the introspection mechanism to automatically discard potentially outdated documents.
6. I saved all the intermediate results, so when any error occurs, you can correct the bug and restart the task, and the task will continue directly from where it was interrupted, without having to start from scratch.
7. Added statistics for token usage and token usage price.
8. Added native language indication in all prompts, therefore, the language used in the final report is always consistent with the language of the user's question. Tested with Chinese and English.

NO WEB UI... I guess this is too difficult for me...

All you need to do is rename config/config.private.template.json to config/config.private.json and provide your own GPT token.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:godisboy0/gpt-researcher.git
cd gpt-researcher
cp config.private.template.json config.private.json 
```
